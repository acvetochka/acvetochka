<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm <a href="https://acvetochka.github.io/Resume" target="_blank">Alona</a> 
<img src="https://github.com/blackcater/blackcater/raw/main/images/Hi.gif" height="32"/></h1>

I'm a beginner web developer with a passion for creating amazing web experiences. I'm excited to share my journey, my projects, and what I bring to the table as a developer.
I've always been fascinated by the world of web development, and I'm eager to expand my knowledge and skills. While I'm relatively new to the field, I have some valuable experience as well. I've had the privilege of serving as a team lead twice and once as a Scrum Master. These roles have allowed me to develop my communication and leadership skills, which I believe will be an asset in my web development career.

<!-- As a beginner, I may not have years of experience, but I bring enthusiasm, dedication, and a commitment to learning. Here's what you can expect from me:

- Passion: I'm incredibly passionate about web development. I'm excited to tackle new challenges and dive into the world of coding.

- Collaboration: My experience as a team lead and Scrum Master has taught me the value of collaboration. I'm a team player who is always ready to work with others to achieve our goals.

- Adaptability: The tech world is constantly evolving, and I'm committed to staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. I'm a quick learner and am excited to adapt to new tools and techniques.

- Problem-Solving: I love solving problems, whether it's debugging code or finding creative solutions to complex challenges. I'm always up for a good puzzle. -->
